Quantile Regression을 적용한 QR-PPO도 스스로 만들어보고(별 효과는 없었다)

multi environment도 해보고 코드를 깔끔하게 정리하진 못했지만,(pytorch 실력이 부족해서)

많은 도전과 실험덕에 좋은 결과를 얻어냈다는게 기분이 좋다.

# Elevator Computation Research
- application of reinforcement learning to improve elevator performance

## Experiments

| Elevator Numbers | Building Heights | Max People in Floor| Max People in Elevator | Epochs | mean convergence point |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 5 | 8 | 8 | 15,168 | 18.6
| 1 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 100,000 | 23.6
| 1 | 7 | 7 | 7 | 100,000 | 29.7
| 1 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 100,000 | 35.3
| 2 | 5 | 8 | 8 | 500,000 | 14.5


## Todo
  - Implement Hierarchy PPO
  - More Test!
  - More insight
  - Clean up the directory
  - applicate more randomized environment
  - build the environment using time ! not a step
  - more accurate test is needed
  
## Implemented Algorithms
  - PPO + GAE
    * one agent
    * multi agent
    * multi environment (more robust)
  - Distributional PPO(QR PPO)
    * one agent



## Update News


### 2019.09.03
  - Readme is updated
  - directory is cleaned up.


## Plot

### Convergance Point Image

#### liftnum : 1, buildingheight : 3, maxpeopleinfloor : 3, maxpeopleinelevator : 3

#### Computation Increasing according to the Elevator's increase
![img](https://github.com/seolhokim/ppo_pytorch_elevator/blob/master/assets/computation_increase.PNG)
  - why Variance is increased?
  * -> Cause States' dimension is increased.



#### Distributional Critic Network test
![img](https://github.com/seolhokim/ppo_pytorch_elevator/blob/master/assets/distributional.PNG)
  - i have thought that distributional critic network can enhance the performance in pomdp. cause model doesn't know passengers' destiny, So distributional reward mapping will be helpful! but it doesn't
  - i tried almost random space!
  
### RUN

~~~
python main.py
~~~

  - if you want to change hyper-parameters, you can check "python main.py --help"
  - you just train and test basic model using main.py
  - if you want to look more various model, then look the note_*
  
  
  - '--test' :  type=bool, default=False, help="True if test, False if train (default: False)"
  - '--epochs' :  type=int, default=100, help='number of epochs, (default: 100)'
  - '--lr_rate' : type=float, default=0.0001, help='learning rate (default : 0.0001)'
  - '--lift_num' : type=int, default=1, help='number of elevators'
  - '--building_height' : type=int, default=5, help='building height '
  - '--max_people_in_floor' : type=int, default=8, help='maximum people in one floor'
  - '--max_people_in_elevator' : type=int, default=8, help='maximum people in one elevator'
  - "--load_file" : type=int, default = 0, help = 'load initial parameters'
  - "--save_interval" : type=int, default = 1000, help = 'save interval'
  - "--print_interval" : type=int, default = 20, help = 'print interval'

### File Description
  - note_training_one_elevator.ipynb : basic one enviroment, one elevator training notebook
  - note_training_multi_elevator.ipynb : basic one environment, multiple elevator training notebook
  - note_seperate_one_elevator.ipynb : one environment, one elevator. but it seperate the network between inside of elevator and inside of building.(it is the first model to try using convolution model. but it made not good result.
  - note_multi_env_one_agent.ipynb : multi environment, one elevator. it is more robust model than one environment.
  - note_multi_env_multi_agent.ipynb : multi environment, multi elevator. it is more robust model than one environment.
  - note_lstm_one_elevator.ipynb : one environment, one elevator. it needs more computation and makes not good result.
  - note_distributional_one_elevator.ipynb : one environment, one elevator. i modified Passenger.py to give more randomness. and tried an experiment. the result was bad.
