## Linear combinations, span and basis
1. **What to learn**
    - What is the **basis**
    - What is the **Linear combinations**
    - What is the **span**
    - What is **linear dependent**
2. **Description**
    - **basis**
        - We can express that vector  in coordination system consists of basis vector's summation and multiplication
            - Example :
                - unit vector of x direction : i, x hat
                - unit vector of y direction : j, y hat
                - Any vector can be explained like ai+bj(a,b are constants)
            - We can call scaling two vectors  and adding as **Linear Combinations**
    - **Linear Combination** can makes three types in 2d coordination
        - Plane
        - Line
        - Zero
    - Set of all linear combinations of given vectors is **Span**
        - So we can call above three types as **Span**
        - If we can remove one vector without shrinking of the span, we can call the vector as **linearly dependent** vector.
            - We can also say that vector is made up of linear combination of another vectors.
        - If one vector can make another dimension of the span, then we can call the vector as **linearly independent** vector.
3. **Next Step**
    - Linear transformations
