## What is the vector?
1. **What to learn** 
    - What is the vector?
    - How to sum(multiply) vectors
2. **Description**
    - Vector is the main components of Linear Algebra
    - What exactly vector is?
        - three distinct ideas
            - Physics
                - Vectors are arrows pointing in space
                    - Two Elements
                        - length
                        - direction
                    - regardless starting point
            - Computer Science
                - order list of number
            - Mathematicsian
            - In this video
                - think vector as arrow from origin
                - think arrows and list alternately(It dosen't matter how we think between them cause it can be alternative each other)
        - **Summation**
            - Think vector A and vector B.
            - we can think A+B as new vector
                - move B's starting point to A's end point. and draw new vector that start from A's starting point to B's end point
        - **Multiplication**
            - Think vector A and scala B
                - if B is positive, then squeeze or expand A by B
                - if B is negative then A is flipped based on starting point and squeezed or expanded
3. **Next Step**
    - Linear combinations, span and bases
